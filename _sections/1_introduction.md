Welcome to the Student Robotics Style Guide. This is the official point of
reference for anyone wishing to use the Student Robotics brand.

The most important thing to note that, while we strive for completeness and
accuracy, this guide will not cover all cases, and ultimate responsibility for
the brand falls to Student Robotics. Even if your use of the Student Robotics
brand follows this guide to the letter, Student Robotics may still request you
change or remove it. Equally, there is room for exceptions to the
rules set out in this guide.
