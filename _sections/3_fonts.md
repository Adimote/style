Content produced by Student Robotics should, by-and-large, use standard fonts. 
This is to increase familiarity with the brand as well as provide a consistent 
experience, which means people know what to expect from our content.

### Headers should be in [Oswald](//www.google.com/fonts/specimen/Oswald).

Normal text should ideally be in Open Sans.
