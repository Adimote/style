### Using the logo

Guidelines regarding use of the logo are as follows:

#### In Context

* There should be sufficient spacing around the logo.

* The logo should be placed on a background which complements the colours. Do
  not, for example, place the blue logo on a similarly coloured blue background.

* The logo shouldn't imply some sort of relationship, or endorsement of anything
  unless you've received confirmation from Student Robotics.

#### Design

* Do not tamper with the colours of the logo.

* Do not change the aspect ratio of the logo. Feel free to resize the logo, but 
  do not stretch or squash it out of proportion.

* Do not change the spacing, alignment or relative position of any of the 
  elements (e.g. symbol, text).
